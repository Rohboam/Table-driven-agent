# Table-driven-agent
This is one of the basic kind of agent in Artificial intelligence.
In this program we will see the how basic Vacuum cleaner works if we use table driven agent..
The agent program takes just the current percept as input because nothing more is available from the environment; if the agent's actions depend on the entire percept sequence, the agent will have to remember the percepts. We will describe the agent programs via the simple pseudo code language.
